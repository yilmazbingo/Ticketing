- version property in tickets ensures that we do not process events twice or out of order. One way to solve events go out of order was to make use of version. If Ticket service emits a series of events all about one kind of ticket beind updated from 10 to 20, from 20 to 30. We assume that these events might flow into our order service or other services in a very particular order. As we when we talk about NATS, it is entirely possible that these events will end up going over to Order SErvide and copletely in jumbled order. We really cannot rely upon the order of events coming into our order service correctly. Everytime we make a change to a ticket, we update the version number inside Ticket service, and ticket service will emit an events and inside of that event we are going to print out that version number.
- order has userId, status, expiresAt and ticketId
- order service listens for Event ticket:created and Event ticket:updated
